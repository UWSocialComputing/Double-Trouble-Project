## Installation Instructions

1. Download either "dist/youtube-extension", or clone the entire repo.

2. Open Chrome (For the purpose of testing, you should use whatever browser you want to)

3. Enter chrome://extensions in the search bar. Make sure you are in developer mode. (you should use whatever browser you want to as long as you're able to load unpacked browser extensions from your local computer)

4. Click "Load Unpacked," then choose the directory "dist/youtube-extension" from this repo. (Keep)

5. Make sure this extension is enabled. If the extension doesn't show up the first time on a video, try refreshing the page.

6. Search up any youtube video to get to a page like: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=reactjs. If the extension is enabled, you should be able to see: Affirm and Refute buttons, and WOW! text.

7. Do note that the buttons will not work as expected currently. Take note of any bugs or unintuitive elements, and leave us some feedback. :)

8. Feel free to also stress test and see if there are any reproduceable situations that cause weird behavior to happen
